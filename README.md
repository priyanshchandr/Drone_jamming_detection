# Drone Jamming Detection

This repository provides a system for detecting and mitigating drone jamming attacks, leveraging advanced techniques such as signal processing, machine learning, and secure communication protocols.

## Overview

The project aims to:
- Simulate drone communication signals.
- Detect jamming signals through spectral analysis.
- Use machine learning models for anomaly detection.
- Implement secure and redundant communication mechanisms.

## Features
1. **Signal Analysis**: Uses FFT to detect anomalies in the frequency spectrum.
2. **Machine Learning**: Employs classification algorithms to identify jamming patterns.
3. **Encryption**: Ensures data security with advanced encryption methods.
4. **Channel Switching**: Mitigates jamming by dynamically switching communication channels.
5. **Logging and Alerts**: Records system activities and alerts users to potential threats.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- Key libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `sklearn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `cryptography`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
